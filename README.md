# Recreating PONG game (beta)

A simple game we used to play in arcade. This is a multiplayer game, players can play using **w, a, s, d** and **&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8595;, &#8594;** keys in the keyboard. This is currently a never ending game, which is in beta phase. In future, I am planning to add an option to let the user set a milestone score to decide the winner. Enjoy!

### NB: Now players can set the highest score before start playing.
