# Recreating PONG game ~~(Beta)~~

A simple game we used to play in arcade. This is a multiplayer game, players can play using **w, a, s, d** and **&#8592;, &#8593;, &#8595;, &#8594;** keys in the keyboard. This is currently a never ending game, which is in beta phase. In future, I am planning to add an option to let the user set a milestone score to decide the winner. Enjoy!

## Enter the highest score you want to set:

#### ~~NB: This game is still in its early stages of development. If the player enters the highest score that is less than or equal to 0 more than once, the paddles will freeze. I'm working on it.~~
#### NB: Solved the problem where the paddles freezes if the user enter the highest score less than or equal to zero.
